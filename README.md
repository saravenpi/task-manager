## How to use it:

- You just have to clone it and make sure to have [node](https://nodejs.org) installed and also [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) (the node package manager)
- then start the command `npm install` to install the dependencies
- then you can start `npm start` to start the project from you command line interface.

At the end you should be able to see the project on this url: `http://localhost:3000`.
And you are ready to go!

## How it's been made:

I've been using NodeJs for this project, with the npm module [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express), and some Html, Css and Javascript as well.
